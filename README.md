> :bulb: **Info**: Official support for this has been merged into the relay-compiler since 06.10.2023!

## Compiler

1. Build the compiler in the relay repository: `cargo build` (Don't forget to set the correct Rust version: `rustup override set 1.64.0`)
2. Execute the built binary from this directory. Binary can be found under `compiler/target/debug/relay`
